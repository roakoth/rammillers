        <p>“Success is built on trust, and trust of the self and others Rachel the founder of  Ramm Millers Limited is a former telecommunication employee who through the early retirement schemes  and having relocated to the community saw and felt the hardest challenge many women and small holders farmers go through in the community. Many women were exploited by middle men trading as brokers using manual weighing scales and yet these women were small holder farmers and semi-skilled. Therefore I saw the need to empower these women by connecting smallholder women farmers to rewarding markets since most activity in community is farming.<br>
I did not have enough money to start the business but I had to fulfill my purpose and help these women out of farming hardship. I wanted to give them hope and make them know there is possibility of getting there maize weighed with right measures, grading and fetching high prices using  certified digital weighing scales which gives them right measures.
Ramm Millers Limited was founded as a private limited company and went into full registration with the registar of companies on 4/4/2019. The company maintains a vision of balancing commercial (profitability) objectives with a social development contribution to the county and country at large. <br>
Since inception, Ramm Millers Limited has a catalytic business inclusive approach and a clear Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) policy, in particular to gender issues, Minority and marginalized people and smallholder farmers who are like the “DNA” of the Company. Based in Uasin Gishu County, KAPSERET MALEL farm, Ramm Millers operate milling plant and a supply outlet for maize flour and animal feeds to her clients. We ventured to milling after noticing a service gap of market access for small scale farmers in North rift region. “I believe that everything is possible and I thank Almighty God to have been there for us to bringing the idea to reality by this mantra of ‘simply doing the best’ . Ramm Millers Limited has grown to its heights over a period of time”.

        <p style="margin-top:20px;">Ramm Millers humble beginnings sprung from outsourcing milling services to household deliveries on hand delivery and eventually grew to a supply chain that needed a bicycle and  two employees. The capital input was small and hence the output was low at that time. There were myriad of challenges at the beginning; Customers were only households and many of them paid after three to four days from the date of delivery. Transport with a bike during rainy seasons was a big challenge, and many customers never relied on me during such weather conditions.</p>
        <p>Amidst the many challenges, Ramm Millerswas able to acquire a TVS motorcycle, thanks to the trust of my suppliers who now had doubled their maize supply and the ever growing product clientele that now was to retail shops, supermarkets, Hotels and restaurants.

 The business has expanded enabling us to erect a milling plant premises so as to accommodate my expanding business and currently milling from the premises.

In this spirit, we acquired a new vehicle (Toyota Probox) and this greatly made it easier to deliver our products to customers although we would still hire a pickup alongside due to raising demand of our product.</p>
        <p>With the current maize shortage and an increase in demand on maize flour in the market since the beginning of this year 2017, we have recently acquired pick up so as to enable the company meet the client’s demands of our products
